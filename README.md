# nrd-IDS-DAPS-client-njs

"Dynamic Attribute Provision Service" (DAPS) node.js client done
 by nicos Research & Development (nrd).

To understand DAPS a little bit better, we suggest to have a look
 at [IDS-G.master/core/DAPS](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/master/core/DAPS).
 
But nowadays it's also a good idea to have an eye on
 [**PREFERRED** : IDS-G.draft/core/DAPS](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-G/tree/draft/core/DAPS),
 because it heavy under development fire... but it is actually the
 basis of this repository **nrd-IDS-DAPS-client-njs** and will move
 to master when it will be a little bit more mature.
 
As done at every nrd node.js code, we try to come as close to
 object-oriented paradigm as possible and try to make code as
 speakable as possible.  

At least we try to avoid to get in touch of nodes module-hell. So let's
 say, get things running with "materials on board", on board of node.js
 itself. nrd hopes you'll endorse!

When **nrd-IDS-DAPS-client-njs** will be a little more mature (and goes
 to `master`-branch) it will be lifted to npm also! So keep in touch and
 watch this `develop`-branch, as you also will follow the `master`-branch!

In a future not so far, we start another series also, like `nrd-IDS-DAPS-client-c#`
 or `nrd-IDS-DAPS-client-java`.
